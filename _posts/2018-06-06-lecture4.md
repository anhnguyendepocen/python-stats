## Bootcamp Project Part II
To complete the final project, you will add onto the Jupyter notebook that you created yesterday.  For today, you will complete the *Analysis* and *Conclusion* sections.  These should be brief, or in outline form.  

### Analysis
Hypothesis Testing
 * Describe a hypothesis that you would like to test pertaining to one outcome variable and two groups (e.g., whether there is a difference in average GPA between two groups of students)
 * What are the null and alternative hypotheses?
 * For simplicity, assume that your data were generated by random sampling
 * Compute the test statistic and discuss whether you can reject the null hypothesis with 95% confidence

Regression
 * Describe a relationship that you would like to estimate with linear regression
 * Does the scatterplot that you created in the *Data* section suggest a linear relationship? If not, what can you do about this?
 * Fit the regression line
 * Discuss the meaning of the estimated intercept and slope

### Conclusion
 * Summarize what you learned about the topic from your analysis
 * Describe the most interesting aspect of your analysis
 * Describe the most challenging aspects of working with your datasets

**Once your project is complete, please update your Github repository and provide the link to the instructor.**
