## Version Control with Git

### Before the workshop
 1. Check whether you already have Git.  
    
    **Windows:** From the command prompt, run `git --version`
    
    **Mac:** From the Terminal, run `git --version`
    
    If git is already installed, you will get a response with the version number, e.g., `git version 2.15.1`.  If not, proceed with the following steps.
 2. Install Git by following [these instructions](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) for your operating system.
 3. From [these instructions](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup), Complete the sections *First-Time Git Setup* and *Your Identity* 

### Basic workflow
 1. Create a repository with a README on [Github](https://github.com)
 2. On your computer, use the command line to clone the repository

    `git clone https://github.com/<your_github_username>/<your_repository_name>.git`
 3. Create a new files or make changes to an existing file
 4. Add the names of any files or directories that you want to ignore to your `.gitignore` file (creating the file if necessary)
 4. When you want to record a snapshot, add the file to the staging area

    `git add <filename>`
 5. Check the status of the repository to make sure the file is properly staged

    `git status`
 6. Commit your changes and include a description of the changes

    `git commit -m "<short description of changes"`
 7. When you want to update your remote repository, push the changes to Github

    `git push origin master`
